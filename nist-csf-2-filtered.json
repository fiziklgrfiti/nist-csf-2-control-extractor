    "abstract": "<p>The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. It offers a taxonomy of highlevel cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization — regardless of its size, sector, or maturity — to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts. The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved. Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes. This document describes CSF 2.0, its components, and some of the many ways that it can be used. </p>",
    "description": "<p>This RegScale catalog digitizes the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0, published in February 2024. The CSF 2.0 is designed to help organizations of all sizes and sectors - including industry, government, academia, and non-profit - to manage and reduce their cybersecurity risks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a filtered version containing only 22 specific controls extracted from the original framework.</p>",
