It offers a taxonomy of highlevel cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization \u2014 regardless of its size, sector, or maturity \u2014 to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts. The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved. Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes. This document describes CSF 2.0, its components, and some of the many ways that it can be used. </p>",
